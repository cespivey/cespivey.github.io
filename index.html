            <h1>Charles Spivey</h1>
            <p>I'm developing <a href="https://broadcourse.bio/">Broadcourse</a> to expand capabilities in drug development</a>.</p>
            <p>Prior to this, I've enjoyed working on research in novel therapeutics for neurological pathologies and autoimmune disorders, developing spectroscopic techniques for quantitative chiral analysis in analytical chemistry, as well as management of software and hardware development in explosive detection systems with DHS. I studied chemistry and biochemistry at UVA. Previously, I developed a project in the consumer products sector producing distilled spirits.</p>
            <p>Recent business interests include formalizing and introducing an option with a variable maturity date set to clinical trial readouts as an instrument for hedge investing in drug development pipelines.</p>
