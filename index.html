            <h1>Charles Spivey</h1>
            <p>I'm developing <a href="https://broadcourse.bio/">Broadcourse</a> to expand capabilities in drug development</a>.</p>
            <p>Prior to this, I've enjoyed contributing to research in novel therapeutics for neurological pathologies and autoimmune disorders and developing spectroscopic techniques for quantitative chiral analysis in analytical chemistry. I've also managed software and hardware development in explosive detection systems with DHS. I studied chemistry and biochemistry at UVA (degrees conferred), with subsequent coursework completed in computer science through Harvard and finance through MIT (online, non-degree programs). Previously, I was the founder of a company in the consumer products sector producing distilled spirits (exit 2023).</p>
            <p>Recent business interests include an initiative to formalize and introduce an option with a variable maturity date set to clinical trial readouts as an instrument for hedge investing in drug development pipelines.</p>
            <p>Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-spivey/">LinkedIn</a> or over email (charles dot edgar dot spivey at gmail dot com). I am currently based in Cambridge and New York.</p>
